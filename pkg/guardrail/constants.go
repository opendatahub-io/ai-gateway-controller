// Package guardrail reconciles AIGuardrail resources: it resolves each
// policy's NeMo provider, evaluates the provider's allowedConsumers
// authorization, verifies provider readiness, and publishes an accepted
// binding on the AIGuardrail status. It does not compile the per-tenant
// Praxis check catalog — that is the catalog reconciler's job (RHAI-2520).
//
// This package deliberately reads NemoGuardrails via unstructured +
// schema.GroupVersionKind rather than importing the TrustyAI operator's Go
// types, for the same reason pkg/tenant reads AITenant unstructured (see
// pkg/tenant/constants.go): pulling in that module's dependency graph is
// unnecessary when the only contract this controller relies on is the
// resource's on-wire JSON shape — spec.allowedConsumers for authorization,
// spec.nemoConfigs and status for readiness and config discovery.
